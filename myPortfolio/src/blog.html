        1. <span class="color-change">D</span>escribe one thing you learned in class today
        One thing that I learned in class today are a few different ways for CSS to be able to apply styles to HTML. One of them is the class selector which can be used multiple times to more than one element. Another style is the ID which can only be applied to 1 element. It is a unique character that can only be used once.

        2. What excites or interests you about coding
        What excites me about coding is being able to style a web page to how you want. I love how you can makes little tweaks to your code and how you can see the changes as you edit it.

        3. What does a doctype do?
        The doctype lets the browser know to read the document in HTML. The doctype is the first thing listed in an HTML document
            <div></div>
        4. Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS Selector?
        The CSS selector consist of multiple parts. First it has the selector which will match back to the HTML document telling the browser which part to style. The second part is the declaration telling the browser what type of property to change and how to change it; what color or what size. A browser will determine how to apply the style in order of importance. First, by the browsers specific settings. Next are the settings established by the user or reader. Lastly is the styles that are applied by the writer.

        1. <span class="color-change">D</span>escribe one thing you learned in class today.
        One thing that I learned in class today was about the whiteboard training and using logic. How there will be some problems that you will come across and have to try and figure out a way to fix your problem. You will need to work with others and use basic logic and reasoning. 
            <div></div>
        2 describe your workflow
        The first step I do is draw out a wireframe of what I want the page to look like. Next thing I will do is write my html tags from the outside in, starting with the body, then the header, then the main and so on into the middle of my page. Then Ill add in the other html tags and place them where I want them. Next I go onto my css and start with the broader styling starting with background color of the whole page. Next ill add style through out and consistently check how it is looking and tweaking when I donâ€™t like something. At the end I add final details to make the page look nice and clean.

        1.	Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website accessible.
        Aria is an acronym for accessible rich internet applications suite. It is making sure that a website is accessible to everyone including people with disabilities whether they are long term or short term. ARIA is attributes you can add to your HTML to make your document more accessible. Screen reader is a software that reads text on the screen out loud. Having a good clean and simple design to your website makes it more accessible and less difficult to navigate
