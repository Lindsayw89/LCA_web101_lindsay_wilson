        <h2>Blog Post one</h2>
        <p>1. Describe one thing you learned in class today</p>
        <p>One thing that I learned in class today are a few different ways for CSS to be able to apply styles to HTML. One of them is the class selector which can be used multiple times to more than one element. Another style is the ID which can only be applied to 1 element. It is a unique character that can only be used once.</p>
        <p>2. What excites or interests you about coding</p>
        <p>What excites me about coding is being able to style a web page to how you want. I love how you can makes little tweaks to your code and how you can see the changes as you edit it.</p>
        <p>3. What does a doctype do?</p>
        <p>The doctype lets the browser know to read the document in HTML. The doctype is the first thing listed in an HTML document</p>
        <p>4. Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS Selector?</p>
        <p>The CSS selector consist of multiple parts. First it has the selector which will match back to the HTML document telling the browser which part to style. The second part is the declaration telling the browser what type of property to change and how to change it; what color or what size. A browser will determine how to apply the style in order of importance. First, by the browsers specific settings. Next are the settings established by the user or reader. Lastly is the styles that are applied by the writer.</p>
